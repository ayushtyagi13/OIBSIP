Data Science Projects - Oasis Internship
This repository contains data science projects developed during the Oasis Internship. These projects leverage various data science techniques and machine learning algorithms to address real-world challenges.

Projects Overview
1. Iris Flower Classification
Description:
This project involves classifying iris flowers into one of three species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on their physical attributes. The dataset used is the renowned Iris dataset, which includes features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Features:

Data preprocessing for cleaning and preparing the dataset.
Training and evaluating classification models.
Metrics to assess model performance.
2. Car Sales Prediction
Description:
This project focuses on predicting car sales prices based on various features like car age, mileage, and brand. The objective is to build regression models to estimate car selling prices accurately.

Features:

Data preprocessing including handling missing values and feature scaling.
Training and evaluation of regression models.
Performance metrics to assess prediction accuracy.
3. Sales Prediction
Description:
This project aims to predict sales figures for a retail store using historical sales data, promotions, store location, and seasonal trends. The goal is to develop a model for forecasting future sales.

Features:

Data preprocessing including cleaning and feature engineering.
Training various regression and time series models.
Evaluation of model performance using suitable metrics.
Data Preprocessing
Each project involves essential preprocessing steps such as:

Handling missing values.
Encoding categorical variables.
Normalizing or scaling features.
Splitting datasets into training and testing sets.
Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on relevant metrics:

Classification Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks.
Regression Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared score for regression tasks.
Results
Iris Flower Classification: Performance metrics and insights for each classification model.
Car Sales Prediction: Accuracy and effectiveness of different regression models.
Sales Prediction: Forecasting results and model performance details.
